## Overview
- The aim of the project was to create a skeleton loading animation which displays while the user is waiting for the actual data to be displayed. It features a couple of dummy empty div tags transitioning from darker grey to lighter grey infinitely until the page content is loaded. The dummy placeholders are then replaced by the actual data.

### The challenge

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
- First, I carefully thought out the building process after lookin at the design file.
- Next, I began by creating the html structure of the page.
- Then I moved forward to create reusable css classes and styles.
- Next, I proceeded to completing the UI with static html data.
- Finally, I added all the fucntionalities with JavaScript and pulled in the displayed data from an API source

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow 


### What I learned

- I learned how to work with JSON data and use API fetch methods.
- I also learnt how to create skeleton placeholder data and replace them with the required data after the page loads
